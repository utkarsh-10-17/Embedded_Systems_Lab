# ⚙️ Embedded Systems Lab – 8051 Assembly Codes

This repository contains assembly language programs written for the **8051 microcontroller**, developed as part of my **Embedded Systems Lab** coursework.  
All programs were written in **assembly language** and tested using **Keil µVision5 (Keilv5)** IDE.
